This work here demonstrates a simulation model for the observation of the brightness of the stars by photon counting with a constant flux virtual star. This virtual star is treated as approximately equal to the blackbody. The overall aim is to study the photons emitted by the blackbody or virtual star as compared to the theoretical result to check how accurately our simulation model or a computational model is working. Certain factors can affect the performance of the model while detecting the number of photons. The following major factors are underlined as-

1.	Atmospheric noise
2.	Photon noise
3.	Atmospheric noise + Photon noise

The first Atmospheric noise is caused due to air bubbles, pollution, or dust and gas particles present in the atmosphere which can distort the path of light or there could be reflectance or absorption of light. 

The third factor does not play a suitable role in this project. So, we are neglecting it.

The second factor is photon noise which is the main focus of our project because we are not dealing with atmospheric noise in our project. The logic behind the occurrence of the photon noise is due to the randomness of the nature of the photon which is discrete. We have to evaluate the statistics (error, mean, variance, etc.) of this randomness and compare it with the theoretical result to check the accuracy and precision of our simulation model.
